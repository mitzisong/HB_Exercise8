[THOU IN WHOSE SWORD-GREAT STORY SHINE THE DEEDS]


  Thou in whose sword-great story shine the deeds
  Of history her heroes, sounds the tread
  Of those vast armies of the marching dead,
  With standards and the neighing of great steeds
  Moving to war across the smiling meads;
  Thou by whose page we break the precious bread
  Of dear communion with the past, and wed
  To valor, battle with heroic breeds;

  Thou, Froissart, for that thou didst love the pen
  While others wrote in steel, accept all praise
  Of after ages, and of hungering days
  For whom the old glories move, the old trumpets cry;
  Who gav'st as one of those immortal men
  His life that his fair city might not die.




A CHORUS GIRL


  When thou hast taken thy last applause, and when
  The final curtain strikes the world away,
  Leaving to shadowy silence and dismay
  That stage which shall not know thy smile again,
  Lingering a little while I see thee then
  Ponder the tinsel part they let thee play;
  I see the red mouth tarnished, the face grey,
  And smileless silent eyes of Magdalen.

  The lights have laughed their last; without, the street
  Darkling, awaiteth her whose feet have trod
  The silly souls of men to golden dust.
  She pauses, on the lintel of defeat,
  Her heart breaks in a smile--and she is Lust ...
  Mine also, little painted poem of God.

  This is the garden: colors come and go,
  Frail azures fluttering from night's outer wing,
  Strong silent greens serenely lingering,
  Absolute lights like baths of golden snow.
  This is the garden: pursed lips do blow
  Upon cool flutes within wide glooms, and sing,
  Of harps celestial to the quivering string,
  Invisible faces hauntingly and slow.

  This is the garden. Time shall surely reap,
  And on Death's blade lie many a flower curled,
  In other lands where other songs be sung;
  Yet stand They here enraptured, as among
  The slow deep trees perpetual of sleep
  Some silver-fingered fountain steals the world.

  It may not always be so; and I say
  That if your lips, which I have loved, should touch
  Another's, and your dear strong fingers clutch
  His heart, as mine in time not far away;
  If on another's face your sweet hair lay
  In such a silence as I know, or such
  Great writhing words as, uttering overmuch,
  Stand helplessly before the spirit at bay;

  If this should be, I say if this should be--
  You of my heart, send me a little word;
  That I may go unto him, and take his hands,
  Saying, Accept all happiness from me.
  Then shall I turn my face, and hear one bird
  Sing terribly afar in the lost lands.




CREPUSCULE


  I will wade out
                 till my thighs are steeped in burn-
  ing flowers
  I will take the sun in my mouth
  and leap into the ripe air
                             Alive
                                   with closed eyes
  to dash against darkness
                           in the sleeping curves of my
  body
  Shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
  with chasteness of sea-girls
                               Will I complete the mystery
  of my flesh
  I will rise
              After a thousand years
  lipping
  flowers
          And set my teeth in the silver of the moon




FINIS


  Over silent waters
                     day descending
                                    night ascending
  floods the gentle glory of the sunset
  In a golden greeting
                        splendidly to westward
  as pale twilight
                   trem-
                         bles
                              into
                                   Darkness
  comes the last light's gracious exhortation
                                        Lifting up to peace
  so when life shall falter
                            standing on the shores of the
  eternal
  god
      May I behold my sunset
  Flooding
          over silent waters




THE LOVER SPEAKS


  Your little voice
                    Over the wires came leaping
  and I felt suddenly
  dizzy
         With the jostling and shouting of merry flowers
  wee skipping high-heeled flames
  courtesied before my eyes
                            or twinkling over to my side
  Looked up
  with impertinently exquisite faces
  floating hands were laid upon me
  I was whirled and tossed into delicious dancing
  up
  Up
  with the pale important
                         stars and the Humorous
                                                moon
  dear girl
  How I was crazy how I cried when I heard
                                           over time
  and tide and death
  leaping
  Sweetly
           your voice

Humanity i love you
because you would rather black the boots of
success than enquire whose soul dangles from his
watch-chain which would be embarrassing for both

parties and because you
unflinchingly applaud all
songs containing the words country home and
mother when sung at the old howard

Humanity i love you because
when you’re hard up you pawn your
intelligence to buy a drink and when
you’re flush pride keeps

you from the pawn shop and
because you are continually committing
nuisances but more
especially in your own house

Humanity i love you because you
are perpetually putting the secret of
life in your pants and forgetting
it’s there and sitting down

on it
and because you are
forever making poems in the lap
of death Humanity

i hate you

i have found what you are like
the rain,

            (Who feathers frightened fields
with the superior dust-of-sleep. wields

easily the pale club of the wind
and swirled justly souls of flower strike

the air in utterable coolness

deeds of green thrilling light
                                  with thinned

newfragile yellows

                      lurch and.press

—in the woods
                      which
                              stutter
                                        and

                                              sing
And the coolness of your smile is
stirringofbirds between my arms;but
i should rather than anything
have(almost when hugeness will shut
quietly)almost,
                  your kiss

if i believe
in death be sure
of this
it is

because you have loved me,
moon and sunset
stars and flowers
gold crescendo and silver muting

of seatides
i trusted not,
                    one night
when in my fingers

drooped your shining body
when my heart
sang between your perfect
breasts

darkness and beauty of stars
was on my mouth petals danced
against my eyes
and down

the singing reaches of
my soul
spoke
the green-

greeting pale-
departing irrevocable
sea
i knew thee death.

                              and when
i have offered up each fragrant
night,when all my days
shall have before a certain

face become
white
perfume
only,
          from the ashes
then
thou wilt rise and thou
wilt come to her and brush

the mischief from her eyes and fold
her
mouth the new
flower with

thy unimaginable
wings,where dwells the breath
of all persisting stars


If earth was heaven and now was hence,
And past was present, and false was true,
There might be some sense
But I’d be in suspense
For on such a pretense
You wouldn’t be you.

If fear was plucky, and globes were square,
And dirt was cleanly and tears were glee
Things would seem fair,—
Yet they’d all despair,
For if here was there
We wouldn’t be we.

as is the sea marvelous
from god’s
hands which sent her forth
to sleep upon the world

and the earth withers
the moon crumbles
one by one
stars flutter into dust

but the sea
does not change
and she goes forth out of hands and
she returns into hands

and is with sleep….

love,
    the breaking

of your
        soul
        upon
my lips

let’s live suddenly without thinking

under honest trees,
                        a stream
does.the brain of cleverly-crinkling
-water pursues the angry dream
of the shore. By midnight,
                                a moon
scratches the skin of the organised hills

an edged nothing begins to prune

let’s live like the light that kills
and let’s as silence,
                            because Whirl’s after all:
(after me)love,and after you.
I occasionally feel vague how
vague idon’t know tenuous Now-
spears and The Then-arrows making do
our mouths something red,something tall

Yeah, right, pops. No jury in the world is going to convict a baby. Well, maybe Texas.
Really? Ah, jeez.
All right, Colossus, you're free to go. But stay away from Death Mountain.
Come again?
I'm not following you.
What?
Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for attempted murder.
Yeah, that's what they all say. They all say d'oh
Did you have the same backwards-talking dream with the flaming cards?
So Superintendent Chalmers can vouch for your whereabouts?
Yeah! All right, okay! I believe you're innocent. Gee, I hope all the suspects are this much fun.
That's all I needed to hear. Boy, this thing works great.
Oh yeah, that was a pretty addictive video game.
They're China's problem now.
Uh sorry, sorry, no dumping in the lake!
I thought that too, until he said yard trimmings. You gotta learn to listen, Lou.
He was talking about it, but I never took him seriously.
Stop, in the name of American squeamishness!
We have a convict we're gonna fry tomorrow, but now we can't.
Aaah!
If that's true, then you should be taking the rap for this, not your son.
You'll have to attend a one hour parenting class.
Alright, men. Open fire!
Who's hurt? Raise your hand.
Without the attitude.
Go fish.
This is my swing set. This is my sandbox. I'm not allowed to go in the deep end.
That's where I saw the leprechaun.
He told me to burn things.
Wanna play stuffed animal parade?
He keeps that stuff in his closet. But he says I'm not allowed in there.
There's the key!
Aah! The pointy kitty took it!
I found a moonrock in my nose.
Hey hey that's our playchair!
He's gonna smell like hotdogs!
Bye Lisa! Tomorrow we find out what five minus three is!
Why do people run from me?
Yes, she is. I love Lisa Simpson, and when I grow up I'm going to marry her.
Dear madam, would you put a price on the air we breathe, or the providence that sustains us?
NEVER!
Dear wife, if I could take but one treasure with me to the next life, it would be your tender kiss.
I like men now.
Take that!
Oh, no! Blow back!
Are you my mommy?
I can put my finger in my nose.
Do I live here?
My knob tastes funny.
Mommy!
I didn't know what I was putting into my body.
Do alligators alligate?
I'm scared!
What's Lyme disease?
Does that mean you went crazy?
My cat's breath smells like cat food
I bent my wookie.
I look like cable tv!
Will you be my mommy?
You smell like dead bunnies!
I'm a brick!
One! One! One! One! Go!
Fireworks make my ears yell!
My daddy's gonna put you in jail.
I'm a gulch!
Hello! I'm Dr. Stupid. I'm gonna take out your liver bones!
Fun toys are fun.
Hi Lisa. Hi Super Nintendo Chalmers.
Hi, Principal Skinner! Hi, Super Nintendo Chalmers! I'm learneding!
I want a tricycle, and a dog who won't chew my Hot Wheels, and a brighter future for America. I'm Ralph Wiggum, and I've been a good boy.
Um, Miss Hoover? There's a dog in the vent.
He was going to the bathroom.
Where are we going, Mr. Simpson?
Hi. Can Lisa come out with her hands up?
I'm a baby bird!

And I want a bike, and a monkey, and a friend for the monkey...
At my house, we call them uh-ohs.
I want to twirl.
Martin Luther King had a dream. Dreams are where Elmo and Toy Story had a party and I was invited. Yay! My turn is over!
